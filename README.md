# Solar System Simulation with React Three Fiber

This project is a 3D simulation of a solar system built using **React Three Fiber**, a React renderer for **Three.js**.
It demonstrates how to create interactive 3D scenes with reusable components, animations, and realistic lighting.

## Features

- **3D Planets**: Render planets with customizable sizes, colors, and positions.
- **Elliptical Orbits**: Simulate elliptical orbits with adjustable radius and eccentricity.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Use ambient and point lights to create a realistic space environment.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular design with reusable React components for planets, orbits, and the sun.
- **Smooth Animations**: Leverage React Three Fiber's animation loop for smooth transitions.

## Technologies Used

- [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) - A React renderer for
